Given a string that consists of left and right parentheses,
'(' and ')', balance the parentheses by inserting parentheses as neccessary.
Determine the minimum number of characters that must be inserted.

Example
s='(()))'
return 1: insert 1 left parenthesis at the left of the string to 
get '((()))'.
